For my CLI project, I scraped the website Songkick, to give users a list of artists playing shows in Denver, CO and provide them with venue information about that event.

The user will run the program, and an indexed list of artists coming to Denver will display. The user is prompted to select a number to view venue information about that artist's event. If the input is valid, the name, address, and a clickable link to the venue's site will return and the user will be asked to exit or view another event's venue details. If the input is not valid, the user receives a sorry message and is again prompted to choose a valid number. 

My approach to creating this CLI application was to set up all of my files, require my gems, and then to scrape and write my code. The process was rewarding, and I'm excited to have my foot in the door to becoming a web developer.
