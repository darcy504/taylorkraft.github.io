For my CLI project, I decided to scrape the website Songkick, to give users a list of artists playing shows in Denver, CO and provide them with venue information about that event.

The user will run the program, and an indexed list of artists coming to Denver will display. The user is prompted to select a number to view venue information about that artist's event. If the input is valid, the name, address, and a clickable link to the venue's site will return and the user will be asked to exit or view another event's venue details. If the input is not valid, the user receives a sorry message and is again prompted to choose a valid number. 

My approach to creating this CLI gem was to set up all of my files, require my gems, and then to scrape and write my code. The first two steps went rather smoothly, then it became time to scrape... It was like everything I had read and learned about scraping HTML was completely lost. So, I spent nearly an entire day researching, watching video walkthroughs and pairing with other students until I felt I was in a confident place with scraping.

The following day I refocused myself and opened up the website's HTML. Things were making a lot more sense, and I had a solid understanding of what I was looking at. BUT I had no idea where to begin with code. I spent a lot of time writing pseudocode that would explain what information the program would provide, and identifying the CSS selectors that held the details I was looking for.

At this point, my gems and files were set up, but the files themselves were empty of code and FULL of notes. It was a mess to look at, and despite trying to be organized, I made things even tougher for myself to follow. So, I cleaned up my files and left just the basics - I simplified my longer notes, created a seperate file for them, and created basic methods for my classes. 

I spent days refactoring, and again pairing with other students in order to understand the concepts I wasn't fully grasping. After meeting with a few others, I had finally gotten some code written AND my program was functioning as expected. I felt a lot more confident in my own abilities, I was able to complete the final touches and see my program in action!

Finally complete, the results of the functioning program were extremely rewarding. I'm excited to continue this journey and build on my newly developed skills.
