I designed a single page web application that utilizes a Rails API backend, which communicates with a Javascript/HTML/CSS frontend to create a grocery list.

To begin, I built my controller actions and created resources for my routes in my backend application. I moved quickly to the frontend of things, beginning with my file structure and building out skeleton classes. As I added functionality, I console logged often to ensure the server was picking up on my functions and event listeners.

I implimented the use of bind, classes, constructors, class functions, fetch requests, event listeners, handlers for my event listeners, as well as adapters.

Overall, this was my least favorite language/project through out the course, but I am excited to move on to React!
