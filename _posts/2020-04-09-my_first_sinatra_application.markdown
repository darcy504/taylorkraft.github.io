For my final project I created SummitColorado, a web application using Sinatra and a SQLite database - designed to allow users to keep a porfolio of the mountains they've climbed in Colorado. I used the Corneal gem to set up my file structure, and Active Record to link my Ruby models to rows in the database table. 

First, I built out my MVC structure - creating my models, controllers, and view files. I started with the basics, creating my classes and placing some very basic html in my erb files to allow something simple to display when testing my routes. Now that things were set up for the most part, I began coding. 

I built out the CRUD structure in my controllers - setting up my routes and the erb files that associated with them. I coded my login page and began testing some routes and inserting some data to play with in a pry. At this point, I was able to create a new user and log them in. Having this functionality, I created routes that would be accessible to the logged in user - displaying information and allowing for user navigation.

I utilized Learn instructional videos, recorded lectures, and the help of some other students to complete the project successfully. Overall, I really enjoyed the process and in the future, I plan on adding additional features and functionality.
